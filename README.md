# javascript-web-page
This is a basic webpage in which I made a submit form asking people for their *name*,*gender* and other personal information.<br />
The interesting thing about this webpage is there are three images, each of them related to a different Anime. When a user hovers over any single one of them then information about the anime and the characters appear on a rectangular box present directly above them on right side of the screen.<br />
This is just a fun page developed by me just to play with some *JavaScript* code and practice my front-end development skills.

## Development:
The webpage is developed on *HTML5*,*CSS3* and *JavaScript*.<br />
*Bootstrap* framework is used.
